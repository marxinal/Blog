I am a Behavioural Data Scientist student who enjoys deploying complex statistical and machine learning models to Big Data. Proficient in predictive modelling, data mining, data processing, problem solving, as well as scripting languages including R and Python. My goal is to bridge the knowledge from Psychology, Data Science, and my passion for music. I desire to deploy highly adaptive diverse services to translate business and functional qualifications into substantial deliverables all to enhance the experience and reachability of music around the world.
